Task - 1
In task 1 we need to find the number is even or odd and takes the input from user. And also use if-else statements.
To find out the the number is even or odd we should know that Even Numbers are exactly divisible by 2 and Odd Numbers are not exactly divisible by 2. 
For even numbers, the remainder when divided by 2 is 0, and for odd numbers, the remainder is 1.
So,I use this statement if x % 2 == 0: For even numbers, Otherwise, else the output should be odd. And i used the Modulo operator (%) because in Python it gives the remainder when one number is divided by another.

Task - 2
Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
	1.	total = 0 → Start with zero.
	2.	for i in range(1, 51) to get 1 to 50 
	3.	total += i → Adds i to the running total.
	4.	After the loop ends → total contains the sum.
